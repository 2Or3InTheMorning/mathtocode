A common operation you'll want to do with vectors or matrices is adding every element. The notation can look scary but it's actually pretty simple:.

math`\sum_{i,j=1}^n {m_{ij}}`

The Σ symbol is a capital σ symbol is called "sigma". It means for some matrix `m`, where `i` represents a row and `j` represents a column, add every element. `n` refers to the number of elements in the variable `m`.

Although you can implement this operation using a for loop, Numpy makes it easy by providing a `sum` method.

Try implementing it now `m.sum()`.
