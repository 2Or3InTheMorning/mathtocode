A common operation you'll want to do with vectors or matrices is adding every element. The notation can look scary but it's actually pretty simple:.

math`\sum_{i,j=1}^n {m_{ij}}`

The math`\Sigma` symbol is a capital math`\sigma` symbol and is called "sigma". It means for some matrix math`m`, where math`i` represents a row and math`j` represents a column, add every element. math`n` refers to the number of elements in the variable math`m`.

Although you can implement this operation using a for loop, NumPy makes it easy by providing a `sum` method.

Try implementing it now `m.sum()`.
