Perfect! Now for your final challenge, let's implement standard deviation:

math`\displaystyle\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n ({x_{i} - \bar{x}) ^ 2} }`

Remember that `x(mean)` refers to the arithmetic mean of `x`. Instead of implementing it from scratch, you can simply call `x.mean()`.

**Tip 1:** Try and build up the equation one step at a time (e.g. starting with subtracting each element by the mean) and checking your answer each time to ensure there are no syntax errors. Then adding the exponentation, etc...

**Tip 2:** Take care to add parentheses where appropriate. E.g. `/` has higher precedence than `-`.
